# CnC Remastered - Enhanced Tanks
> A Mod for Tiberian Dawn enhancing Light and Medium Tanks. 

The purpose of this mod is to enhance light and medium tanks. I thought it would be cool if these vehicles could 
carry infantry units and had secondary weapons to defend themselves from infrantry. 

## Changes
- Light tanks can carry 1 infantry unit
- When transporting an infantry unit light tanks will use a flame thrower against enemy infantry units.
- Medium tanks can carry 2 infantry units
- When transporting at least one infantry unit medium tanks will use a MG to defend themselves from enemy infantry units.

## Note
This mod is currently for Tiberian Dawn only.
